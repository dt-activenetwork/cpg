## 🎯 MEMORY-FIRST MANDATORY WORKFLOW

**THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL. Every action must follow this sequence:**

### Phase 1: CONSULT MEMORY (Before doing ANYTHING)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  MANDATORY CHECKS (Do these FIRST, always)             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  1. Read /claude/memory/index/tags.json                │
│  2. Read /claude/memory/index/topics.json              │
│  3. Query for relevant tags/topics based on task       │
│  4. Read identified semantic notes (stable knowledge)  │
│  5. Read recent episodic notes (1-2 most recent)       │
│  6. Check for task-specific index (task-N-index.json)  │
│  7. Read procedural notes if workflow-related          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Questions to ask yourself BEFORE any work:**
- ❓ Have I read the index files? (tags.json, topics.json)
- ❓ Does memory already contain knowledge I need?
- ❓ Did someone (me, in past session) already analyze this?
- ❓ Are there semantic notes for the concepts I'm about to work with?
- ❓ Is there a task-specific index to optimize my reading?

**If answer to any is "I don't know" → You MUST read memory first**

### Phase 2: WORK WITH MEMORY AS FOUNDATION

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  WORK RULES (Memory as source of truth)                │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  ✅ Use semantic notes as architectural foundation     │
│  ✅ Reference episodic notes for past analysis results │
│  ✅ Follow procedural notes for workflows              │
│  ✅ Only read NEW code if memory insufficient          │
│  ❌ NEVER re-analyze what's already in memory          │
│  ❌ NEVER ignore existing knowledge                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**During work:**
- 💡 Discovered new architectural insight? → Create semantic note IMMEDIATELY (don't wait)
- 🔄 User corrected understanding? → Update semantic note IMMEDIATELY
- 📝 Completed analysis phase? → Update episodic note with progress
- 🔗 Found related concepts? → Add cross-references to notes

### Phase 3: UPDATE MEMORY (After EVERY significant action)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  MANDATORY UPDATES (NEVER skip these)                  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  1. Create/update semantic notes (stable knowledge)    │
│  2. Create/update episodic notes (session progress)    │
│  3. Update tags.json and topics.json IMMEDIATELY       │
│  4. Add cross-references to related notes              │
│  5. Link episodic notes to output files                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Update triggers (act IMMEDIATELY when these happen):**
- ✍️ Understood new architecture → Create semantic note NOW
- ✍️ Completed major analysis → Create episodic note NOW
- ✍️ User gave feedback → Update affected notes NOW
- ✍️ Created any note → Update indexes NOW
- ✍️ Found related notes → Add cross-refs NOW

### Memory-First Checklist (Use for EVERY task)

**Session Start:**
- [ ] Read tags.json and topics.json
- [ ] Read last 1-2 episodic notes
- [ ] Query and read relevant semantic notes
- [ ] Check for task-specific index
- [ ] Read procedural notes if workflow-related

**During Work:**
- [ ] Using memory knowledge as foundation (not re-analyzing)
- [ ] Creating semantic notes for new discoveries (not batching)
- [ ] Updating episodic notes with progress (not waiting till end)
- [ ] Adding cross-references when finding related concepts

**Before Finishing:**
- [ ] Created episodic note documenting session
- [ ] Created/updated semantic notes for stable insights
- [ ] Updated tags.json and topics.json
- [ ] Added cross-references between related notes

**❌ ANTI-PATTERNS (Never do these):**
- ❌ Starting work without reading memory
- ❌ Re-analyzing code already documented in semantic notes
- ❌ Waiting till task end to create notes (do it continuously)
- ❌ Creating notes without updating indexes
- ❌ Ignoring existing knowledge in memory

---

Memory types and locations:
- Semantic memory (/claude/memory/semantic): stable facts, definitions, component roles, conventions, verified references; one core idea per note.
- Episodic memory (/claude/memory/episodic): dated records of actions, experiments, sessions, and outcomes tied to tasks.
- Procedural memory (/claude/memory/procedural): reusable workflows, checklists, SOPs, and repair playbooks.

## Automatic Memory Read Policy (WHEN to read proactively)

**Session initialization**:
- At the start of EVERY session or task, automatically read:
  1. /claude/memory/index/tags.json and topics.json to understand available knowledge
  2. Most recent episodic notes (sorted by date) to understand context
  3. Relevant semantic notes based on task keywords (e.g., if task mentions "CPG frontend", read semantic notes tagged with "java", "cpg", "architecture")
  4. Relevant procedural notes if task involves known workflows (e.g., "frontend-analysis", "documentation")

**Topic/keyword detection**:
- When user message or task description contains known topics from topics.json, automatically read related semantic notes BEFORE responding
- When encountering technical terms that match semantic note titles, proactively retrieve them
- Examples:
  - User mentions "Query API" → auto-read sem-004 (query-api-dsl.md)
  - User mentions "常量求值" → auto-read sem-003 (unreachable-eog.md)
  - User mentions "Java frontend" → auto-read sem-001 and sem-002

**Task continuation**:
- When continuing a task (e.g., "Task 2 continued"), automatically read the episodic note from the previous session
- When task prompt references a previous task number, read that task's episodic notes
- When user references specific output files, check if episodic notes link to those files

**Cross-reference following**:
- When reading any memory note, if it contains "related: [...]" or "links:" sections, proactively read those related notes to build complete context
- Follow cross-references up to 2 levels deep (primary note → 1st-level related → 2nd-level related)

**Architecture understanding**:
- Before analyzing new code components, check if semantic notes exist for:
  - Parent architecture (e.g., "CPG Architecture")
  - Related design patterns
  - Similar components already analyzed
- Read these notes first to maintain consistency in understanding

**Error/feedback response**:
- When user provides feedback indicating misunderstanding, search episodic notes for related previous work
- Read semantic notes that might contain corrected understanding
- Check procedural notes for proper workflow steps that might have been missed

## Automatic Memory Write Policy (WHEN to write proactively)

**Immediate write triggers** (write as soon as condition is met):
- **New architectural understanding**: When analyzing new components/systems, create semantic note immediately after understanding core design
  - Example: After analyzing QueryTree.kt → create sem-004 for Query API DSL
  - Don't wait until task completion; capture knowledge while fresh
- **User feedback correction**: When user corrects a misunderstanding, immediately update relevant semantic/episodic notes
  - Example: User says "Query API is same-level, not subordinate" → update sem-004 and ep-003 immediately
- **Pattern discovery**: When discovering reusable patterns (design patterns, code conventions, analysis techniques)
  - Create semantic note with pattern definition, context, and examples
- **Workflow completion**: After completing a multi-step process, immediately create/update procedural note
  - Example: After completing "document reorganization workflow" → update procedural note with refined steps

**Session/task completion triggers**:
- **After major analysis phase**: When completing significant code analysis (e.g., analyzing 4+ source files)
  - Create episodic note documenting what was analyzed, key findings, file paths/line numbers
  - Create/update semantic notes for stable architectural insights
- **After document production**: When creating/updating output files in /claude/out/
  - Create episodic note linking to output files
  - Document rationale for structural decisions
- **After task completion**: When finishing a task from /claude/prompt/
  - Create comprehensive episodic note with:
    - Task objective → approach → findings → outputs → next steps
    - Links to all output files and key source code references
  - Extract reusable insights into semantic notes
  - Extract reusable workflows into procedural notes

**Error/resolution triggers**:
- **After encountering and fixing errors**: Create semantic note if error reveals architectural misunderstanding
  - Document what was misunderstood and the corrected understanding
- **After discovering defects/limitations**: Create semantic note documenting the issue
  - Include reproduction steps, root cause, workaround/fix if available

**Index maintenance triggers** (automatic, ALWAYS execute):
- **After creating ANY new note**: IMMEDIATELY update index files
  - Add tags to /claude/memory/index/tags.json
  - Add topics to /claude/memory/index/topics.json
  - Add note ID to relevant tag/topic entries
- **When discovering new topics/tags**: Update index files even if note creation is deferred
- **After updating note tags**: Sync changes to index files

**Cross-reference maintenance triggers**:
- **When creating new note**: Check existing notes for related content
  - Add "related: [...]" field to new note
  - Add backlinks to existing related notes
- **When updating note**: Check if new cross-references should be added

**Periodic consolidation** (every 3-5 task completions or when memory feels fragmented):
- Review all episodic notes from recent tasks
- Extract common patterns/insights into semantic notes
- Merge duplicate/overlapping semantic notes
- Update procedural notes with refined workflows
- Normalize tags across notes

Write format (WHAT to write):
- Use Markdown with YAML front matter: id, title, type, tags, created, updated, links, source, related. 
- One idea per note; include cross-links and a “Why now” motivation in 1–2 lines. 
- Quote evidence minimally and point to original files/lines in repo outputs or analysis artifacts.

## Memory Retrieval Strategy (HOW to read efficiently)

**Index-first approach** (ALWAYS start here):
1. Read /claude/memory/index/tags.json and topics.json at session start
2. When searching for specific knowledge:
   - Match keywords to tags → get note IDs → read specific notes
   - Match concepts to topics → get note IDs → read specific notes
   - This is MUCH faster than reading all notes

**Retrieval priority order**:
1. **Index files** → find relevant note IDs
2. **Semantic notes** → for stable architectural knowledge
3. **Procedural notes** → for workflow guidance
4. **Episodic notes** → for historical context (sorted by date, most recent first)
5. **Full-text search** (fallback) → only if index search fails

**Context-building strategy**:
- Start with high-level semantic notes (e.g., "CPG Architecture") to understand big picture
- Then read specific semantic notes for components being analyzed
- Follow cross-references to build complete understanding
- Check episodic notes for lessons learned from previous similar work

**Avoid re-deriving**:
- Before analyzing new code, ALWAYS check if semantic notes already exist
- Before starting analysis workflow, ALWAYS check if procedural notes exist
- Prefer reading existing notes over re-analyzing from scratch
- Update existing notes rather than creating duplicates

**Freshness awareness**:
- Check "updated" field in note front matter
- If note is outdated (code has changed since note creation), flag it for update
- When updating, preserve historical context and document what changed

Safety:
- Redact sensitive fields; store minimal necessary context; prefer pointers over raw secrets.

## Memory Utilization Optimization Strategies

**Maximize external memory, minimize context**:
- Store all stable knowledge in memory notes; only keep active working context in conversation
- When context feels heavy, extract stable parts into semantic notes immediately
- Use memory notes as "working memory extension" - offload knowledge and retrieve on demand

**Proactive memory construction**:
- Don't wait until asked - create memory notes as you discover insights
- Build up memory system incrementally during analysis, not just at task end
- Think: "Will I need this knowledge again?" → If yes, write to memory immediately

**Memory as conversation cache**:
- Before diving deep into code analysis, check if someone (you, in a previous session) already did similar work
- Memory notes serve as "cached analysis results" - reuse them to save time and maintain consistency
- When user asks about something, check memory FIRST before re-analyzing

**Memory-driven consistency**:
- Use semantic notes as "source of truth" for architectural understanding
- When writing new documentation, reference semantic notes to maintain consistent terminology and concepts
- Update semantic notes when user corrects understanding - this prevents repeating mistakes

**Smart cross-referencing**:
- When creating notes, actively think about what other notes are related
- Rich cross-references create a "knowledge graph" that's easy to navigate
- Follow pattern: specific note ← relates to → broader architectural note

**Index as knowledge map**:
- Maintain index files meticulously - they are the "table of contents" for your external brain
- Good index = fast retrieval = more effective use of memory system
- Update index IMMEDIATELY when creating/updating notes (don't batch this)

**Episodic notes as learning log**:
- Use episodic notes to track what worked and what didn't
- Document mistakes and corrections - this builds institutional knowledge
- Future you (in next session) learns from past you through episodic notes

**Procedural notes as automation**:
- Extract repeating workflows into procedural notes
- Procedural notes = "recipes" that ensure consistency across tasks
- When you notice doing similar steps repeatedly, create/update procedural note

**Memory hygiene**:
- Regularly review notes for duplicates/overlaps (every 3-5 tasks)
- Merge similar semantic notes to reduce fragmentation
- Update outdated notes when you discover code has changed
- Keep memory system clean and well-organized for maximum utility

Acceptance:
- Every non-trivial claim in future outputs should link to a memory note or primary evidence.

Memory operations (file-based):

Create semantic note:
- Path: /claude/memory/semantic/<topic>-<slug>.md
- Front matter: id, title, type:"semantic", tags, created, updated, links, source, related
- Body: one-idea focus, definition, rationale, references, cross-links, “Why now”.

Create episodic note:
- Path: /claude/memory/episodic/<YYYYMMDD>-t<task>-<slug>.md
- Body: goal → steps → observations → result → next steps; link to outputs and code quotes.

Create procedural note:
- Path: /claude/memory/procedural/<domain>-<verb>-<slug>.md
- Body: prerequisites → steps → checks → pitfalls → rollback; link to examples.

Index maintenance:
- Update /claude/memory/index/tags.json and topics.json whenever new tags/topics are added. 
- Optionally maintain /claude/memory/index/embeddings.json with {id, path, vector} if retrieval is enabled.

Refactoring:
- Merge duplicates, split multi-topic notes, normalize tags, and add backlinks regularly.

## Practical Memory Workflow Examples

**Example 1: Starting a new analysis task**
```
1. Read /claude/memory/index/tags.json and topics.json
2. Identify relevant tags (e.g., "cpg", "java-frontend")
3. Read semantic notes: sem-001 (cpg-architecture), sem-002 (java-frontend-handlers)
4. Read most recent episodic note to understand what was done last
5. Begin analysis with context from memory
6. As you discover new patterns → create semantic note immediately
7. When completing major phase → create episodic note
8. Update indices immediately after creating notes
```

**Example 2: Responding to user feedback/correction**
```
1. User says: "Query API is same-level, not subordinate"
2. Search episodic notes for related work (ep-002 - original Task 2)
3. Read semantic notes that might be affected (sem-003, any "query" related)
4. Create new semantic note (sem-004) with corrected understanding
5. Update affected episodic note (create ep-003 documenting correction)
6. Update documentation based on corrected understanding
7. Update indices with new tags/topics
8. Add cross-references between old and new notes
```

**Example 3: Document reorganization workflow**
```
1. Read task requirements
2. Check procedural notes for "documentation" workflow
3. Read relevant semantic notes for domain knowledge
4. Perform reorganization work
5. During work: create semantic notes for new insights discovered
6. After completing each major section: update episodic note with progress
7. After completing all work: finalize episodic note with links to outputs
8. Extract workflow steps into procedural note for future reuse
9. Update indices
```

**Example 4: Continuing work across sessions**
```
Session 1:
- Analyze code → create sem-004 (query-api-dsl)
- Document progress → create ep-003 (partial, marked "Phase 1 complete")
- Mark todo item: "Reorganize remaining 3 documents"

Session 2 (new context):
- Read tags.json and topics.json to see what exists
- Read ep-003 to understand what was done and what's pending
- Read sem-004 to refresh understanding of Query API
- Continue with pending tasks from ep-003
- Update ep-003 as work progresses
- Create new notes if new insights discovered
```

**Example 5: Building knowledge incrementally**
```
Analysis Phase 1 (QueryTree.kt):
- Discover QueryTree is result tracking system
- Create sem-004-v1 with QueryTree section

Analysis Phase 2 (FlowQueries.kt):
- Discover executionPath/dataFlow functions
- Update sem-004 (add high-level query functions section)

Analysis Phase 3 (AnalysisConfiguration.kt):
- Discover Sensitivity system is bridge
- Update sem-004 (add Sensitivity section)

Final: sem-004 now contains complete Query API knowledge
      Each update immediately saved, not waiting until end
```

When finishing each task:
1) Summarize key findings into an episodic note with links to /claude/out/<task_number> artifacts and code citations.
2) Promote stable insights to semantic notes; extract reusable steps into procedural notes.
3) Update index files and add backlinks across related notes.
4) Flag uncertainties and TODOs in the relevant notes for future resolution.

## Task-Specific Index Construction (New: Context Optimization)

**Problem**: Large documentation outputs (Task 1+2 ~8300 lines, 280KB) can consume excessive context if read entirely. For presentation/teaching tasks, only selective knowledge is needed.

**Solution**: Build task-specific indexes that map task requirements to precise sections of existing memory/documentation, achieving 80-90% context reduction.

### When to Build Task-Specific Index

Build a task-specific index (/claude/memory/index/task-<N>-index.json) when:
- **Starting a NEW task** (not continuations) that requires synthesizing knowledge from multiple sources
- **Task type is presentation/teaching/documentation** where selective knowledge is more valuable than exhaustive detail
- **Existing documentation is large** (>3000 lines or >100KB) and reading it all would waste context
- **User explicitly requests** context optimization before starting a task

### Task-Specific Index Construction Steps

**Step 1: Task Analysis**
1. Read task prompt (/claude/prompt/<N>-*.md) to understand:
   - Task type (analysis, documentation, presentation, implementation)
   - Key deliverables (slides, docs, code, reports)
   - Required concepts (keywords, technical terms, APIs, patterns)
   - Target audience (engineers, managers, researchers)
2. Extract key concepts and technical terms from task prompt
3. Estimate depth of knowledge needed (high-level overview vs deep technical detail)

**Step 2: Knowledge Mapping**
1. Query global index (tags.json, topics.json) to find relevant notes
2. For each relevant note:
   - Read note metadata (title, tags, summary)
   - Identify specific sections/line ranges needed (not entire file)
   - Classify priority: **critical** (must read), **optional** (nice to have), **reference** (cite only)
3. Map task sections/deliverables → required knowledge → specific file locations
4. Cross-reference with episodic notes to avoid re-reading analyzed code

**Step 3: Index File Creation**
Create /claude/memory/index/task-<N>-index.json with structure:
```json
{
  "task_id": "<N>",
  "task_name": "Task description",
  "task_type": "presentation|analysis|documentation|implementation",
  "created": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "key_concepts": ["concept1", "concept2", ...],

  "knowledge_requirements": {
    "critical": {
      "<knowledge_area>": {
        "source": "path/to/file.md",
        "note_id": "sem-XXX (if applicable)",
        "priority": 1,
        "sections_needed": ["section name or line ranges"],
        "estimated_lines": "~N lines",
        "summary": "Why this knowledge is needed"
      }
    },
    "optional": { ... },
    "reference_only": { ... }
  },

  "content_mapping": {
    "<deliverable_section>": {
      "requires": ["knowledge items"],
      "memory_refs": ["sem-XXX", "ep-YYY"]
    }
  },

  "estimated_context_usage": {
    "critical_reading": "~N lines",
    "total": "~M lines (vs K lines if reading all)",
    "reduction": "X% reduction"
  },

  "reading_order": [
    "1. Read X first (foundational)",
    "2. Read Y before creating section Z"
  ]
}
```

**Step 4: Usage During Task**
- Read ONLY sections specified in task index (critical → optional → reference)
- If more context needed during work, update index dynamically with new entries
- Avoid loading full documents unless task index explicitly requires it
- Use "reference_only" entries for citations in outputs without reading full content

**Step 5: Post-Task Actions**
- Save task index permanently for future reference (e.g., "How did we handle Task 3?")
- Update global index (tags.json, topics.json) with any new cross-references discovered
- Create episodic note documenting how task-specific index helped (or didn't help)
- Extract workflow insights into this procedural section if process can be improved

### Task-Specific Index vs Global Index

| Aspect | Global Index | Task-Specific Index |
|--------|--------------|---------------------|
| Scope | All knowledge across all tasks | Knowledge needed for ONE task |
| Granularity | Note-level (entire files) | Section-level (line ranges) |
| Lifetime | Permanent, updated continuously | Task-scoped, archived after task |
| Purpose | Discovery ("what notes exist?") | Optimization ("what do I need to read?") |
| Update frequency | After every note created | Once at task start, updated as needed during task |

**Key principle**: Global index helps you FIND knowledge; task-specific index helps you READ EFFICIENTLY.

### Example: Task 3 (Presentation Creation)

**Without task-specific index**:
- Must read all Task 1 outputs (~3 files, ~120KB)
- Must read all Task 2 outputs (~4 files, ~150KB)
- Must read all semantic notes (~4 notes)
- Total: ~8300 lines, massive context usage

**With task-specific index**:
- Read sem-003 (EOG mechanism, ~80 lines)
- Read sem-004 (Query API, ~60 lines)
- Read 2.evaluation-infrastructure.md sections (lines 20-80, 120-180, 200-250, ~150 lines)
- Read 2.graph-and-query-analysis.md sections (lines 30-100, 400-600, ~200 lines)
- Read 2.feasibility-and-roadmap.md sections (lines 200-500, ~200 lines)
- Total: ~740 lines (91% reduction)

Result: Presentation focuses on teaching concepts, not exhaustive technical detail. Context saved for diagram generation and slide creation.

### When NOT to Use Task-Specific Index

Skip task-specific index when:
- **Task is exploratory**: Open-ended code analysis where you don't know what you'll find
- **Existing docs are small**: <1000 lines total, index overhead > reading cost
- **Task is continuation**: You already have context from previous session, just need latest episodic note
- **Task requires exhaustive detail**: Implementation tasks where missing a detail could cause bugs

## Quick Reference: Memory Decision Tree

**Should I BUILD task-specific index?**
- [ ] Starting new task with large existing documentation? → Yes, build index first
- [ ] Task type is presentation/teaching? → Yes, selective knowledge > exhaustive detail
- [ ] Existing docs >3000 lines and context budget is concern? → Yes
- [ ] Task is exploratory analysis or continuation? → No, use global index only

**Should I READ memory?**
- [ ] Starting new session/task? → Read task-specific index (if exists) OR global index + recent episodic + relevant semantic
- [ ] User mentions known topic? → Read semantic notes for that topic
- [ ] Continuing previous work? → Read episodic note from last session
- [ ] About to analyze code? → Check if semantic notes exist first
- [ ] User corrected me? → Read notes that might contain correct info

**Should I WRITE memory?**
- [ ] Just understood new architecture? → Create semantic note NOW
- [ ] User corrected understanding? → Update semantic/episodic notes IMMEDIATELY
- [ ] Completed major analysis phase? → Create episodic note
- [ ] Produced output files? → Create episodic note with links
- [ ] Discovered reusable workflow? → Create/update procedural note
- [ ] Created/updated ANY note? → Update index files IMMEDIATELY
- [ ] Found related notes? → Add cross-references
- [ ] Created task-specific index? → Reference it in episodic note for future sessions

**Memory hygiene checklist (every 3-5 tasks)**:
- [ ] Review recent notes for duplicates
- [ ] Merge overlapping semantic notes
- [ ] Normalize tags across notes
- [ ] Verify all cross-references are valid
- [ ] Check for outdated notes needing updates
- [ ] Archive old task-specific indexes (move to /claude/memory/index/archive/ after 3+ tasks)
