# System Improvement: Incremental Work Principle

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Type**: Memory System Enhancement
**Status**: Complete

---

## Goal

Add a critical missing principle to the AI Agent prompt system: **Incremental Work with Memory Checkpoints** to prevent context overflow and ensure work continuity for large tasks.

---

## Context

### User Observation

User identified a key gap in the system: "做任何事情时尽可能分步,以免上下文窗口溢出,每一个步骤的前后都去维护记忆系统,好让步骤连续"

**Translation**: "When doing anything, break work into steps as much as possible to prevent context window overflow. Maintain memory system before and after each step to ensure step continuity."

### The Missing Principle

While the existing system emphasized:
- ✅ Memory-First (read memory before work)
- ✅ Continuous Updates (create notes immediately)
- ✅ Context Optimization (task-specific indexes)

It **did not explicitly mandate**:
- ❌ Task decomposition for large work
- ❌ Memory checkpoints between steps
- ❌ Context budget per step (<2000 lines)
- ❌ Resumability requirements

### Why This Matters

**Large tasks** (>5000 lines context) risk:
1. Context overflow (exceeding window limits)
2. Work loss (if interrupted mid-task)
3. Poor progress tracking (all-or-nothing execution)
4. Lack of resumability (can't continue if interrupted)

**Example**: Task 3 (presentation) requires ~11,000 lines if done monolithically, but only ~2,400 lines if done incrementally with checkpoints.

---

## Approach

### Strategy

Implement the Incremental Work Principle across three layers:

1. **Procedural Layer** (proc-004): Complete operational workflow
   - 4-phase step structure (Checkpoint In → Work → Checkpoint Out → Verify)
   - Task decomposition decision trees
   - Context budget rules (<2000 lines/step)
   - Checkpoint format specifications
   - Real-world examples and anti-patterns

2. **Architecture Layer** (CLAUDE.md): High-level principle explanation
   - Problem statement (context overflow)
   - Solution pattern (incremental + checkpoints)
   - When to use (>5000 lines context)
   - Quick decision guide
   - Performance metrics

3. **Integration Layer** (proc-003 update): Checklist integration
   - Add "For large tasks" section to checklist
   - Add "During incremental work" checks
   - Add "Before finishing (incremental)" validation
   - Link to proc-004 for details

### Implementation Steps

Followed the incremental approach itself:

```
Step 1: Create proc-004 documentation → Checkpoint (ep-005 created)
Step 2: Update CLAUDE.md with principle → Checkpoint (ep-005 updated)
Step 3: Update proc-003 checklist → Checkpoint (ep-005 updated)
Step 4: Update indexes (tags.json, topics.json) → Checkpoint (ep-005 updated)
Step 5: Create episodic note (this document) → Final checkpoint
```

**Meta-note**: This improvement work itself demonstrates the principle by being done incrementally with checkpoints!

---

## Findings

### 1. Principle Was Scattered, Not Unified

**Before**:
- proc-003 mentioned "update continuously" (line 91-116)
- Anti-pattern mentioned "don't batch notes" (line 479)
- But no explicit "decompose tasks" or "context budget" rules

**After**:
- proc-004: Complete workflow (650+ lines)
- CLAUDE.md: Clear principle section (~150 lines)
- proc-003: Extended checklist with incremental checks

### 2. Context Budget Was Implicit, Not Enforced

**Before**: No clear limit on step size
**After**: Hard limit of <2000 lines per step (documented in proc-004)

### 3. Checkpoint Format Was Undefined

**Before**: Episodic notes existed but no standard for progress tracking
**After**:
- "Progress Tracking" section (Completed Steps, Pending Steps)
- "Context for Next Step" section (resumability)
- Checkpoint verification checklist

### 4. Decomposition Strategies Were Missing

**Before**: No guidance on how to break down tasks
**After**: Decision trees for decomposition by:
- File groups (5-10 files per step)
- Sections (200-400 lines per section)
- Concepts (one concept per step)
- Phases (research → documentation → review)

## Impact Analysis

### Immediate Benefits

1. **Clear Guidance**: AI Agent now has explicit instructions for handling large tasks
2. **Context Safety**: Hard limit (<2000 lines/step) prevents overflow
3. **Resumability**: Checkpoint mechanism enables work continuation
4. **Progress Tracking**: User can see completion status at each step
5. **Risk Reduction**: Only current step affected by errors, not entire task

### Performance Impact

**Before** (monolithic Task 3):
- Context: ~11,000 lines (task prompt + all Task 1+2 outputs)
- Risk: High (context overflow, work loss if interrupted)
- Resumability: None (must restart from beginning)

**After** (incremental Task 3):
- Context per step: <1000 lines (avg)
- Total context: ~2,400 lines across 6 steps
- Savings: 78% context reduction
- Resumability: 6 checkpoints (can resume from any)

### Coverage

**Tasks Affected**:
- ✅ Task 3 (presentation): 40 slides, would be >11,000 lines monolithic
- ✅ Large codebase analysis (>10 files)
- ✅ Long documentation (>1000 lines output)
- ✅ Multi-phase tasks (research + doc + review)

**Tasks Not Affected**:
- Small tasks (<5000 lines total): Continue as before, no decomposition needed
- Questions/queries: Already optimized via memory system

---

## Lessons Learned

### 1. User Identified a Real Gap

The user's observation was **100% correct**: The system lacked explicit guidance on:
- Breaking work into steps
- Context budget per step
- Memory checkpoints for continuity

This gap could cause:
- Context overflow on large tasks
- Work loss if interrupted
- Poor user experience (no progress visibility)

### 2. Principle Was Implicit, Needed to Be Explicit

Elements existed (e.g., "update continuously") but were:
- Scattered across documents
- Not formalized as a mandatory workflow
- Lacking concrete rules (e.g., <2000 lines/step)

**Solution**: Create dedicated procedural note (proc-004) with:
- Explicit rules and limits
- Decision trees for when/how to decompose
- Checkpoint format specifications
- Verification checklists

### 3. Multi-Layer Integration Is Key

Adding principle required changes at 3 layers:
1. **Procedural** (proc-004): Detailed operational workflow
2. **Architecture** (CLAUDE.md): High-level principle explanation
3. **Integration** (proc-003): Checklist updates for daily use

**Benefit**: AI Agent sees principle in multiple contexts:
- In CLAUDE.md when starting session
- In proc-003 when using memory-first workflow
- In proc-004 when needing detailed guidance

### 4. Eating Our Own Dog Food

This improvement work itself was done incrementally:
- Step 1: Create proc-004 → Checkpoint
- Step 2: Update CLAUDE.md → Checkpoint
- Step 3: Update proc-003 → Checkpoint
- Step 4: Update indexes → Checkpoint
- Step 5: Create ep-005 → Final checkpoint

**Result**: Work was resumable, progress trackable, context manageable

## Next Steps

### Immediate

- [x] Create proc-004
- [x] Update CLAUDE.md
- [x] Update proc-003
- [x] Update indexes
- [x] Create ep-005

### Future Enhancements

**Potential**:
1. Create task-specific indexes for other large tasks (Task 1, Task 2 if needed)
2. Add examples of incremental work to other procedural notes
3. Monitor context usage in future tasks to validate <2000 line limit
4. Consider adding auto-checkpoint reminders (if AI Agent goes >30 min without memory update)

**Not Urgent**: System is complete as-is. Above are nice-to-haves.

### User Request Fulfillment

**User's request**: "做任何事情时尽可能分步,以免上下文窗口溢出,每一个步骤的前后都去维护记忆系统,好让步骤连续"

**System now provides**:
- ✅ Explicit task decomposition guidance (proc-004)

**Meta-Reflection**: This improvement demonstrates the value of user feedback. The user identified a real gap that, while partially addressed by existing practices, needed to be formalized and made explicit. The resulting system is now more robust, with clear rules for handling large tasks without context overflow.
