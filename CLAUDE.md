# AI Agent Prompt System Guide

Welcome to this AI Agent Prompt System, designed to assist you in analyzing a Java monorepo, generating professional documentation, and addressing potential defects.

To ensure the AI Agent accurately understands your intentions and executes tasks efficiently, we have designed a structured set of Prompt files.

## Prompt File Location

All AI Agent task instructions (Prompt files) are centrally located under the `/claude/prompt/` directory.

## Prompt File Reading Order and Structure

Please follow the suggested order for reading and utilizing these Prompt files:

1.  **Global Configuration Prompts (e.g., `0.overview.md`)**
    *   Any prompt file starting with `0.` (e.g., `0.overview.md`) defines **mandatory global rules and configurations** that all subsequent tasks and outputs must strictly adhere to.
    *   `0.overview.md` specifically provides a comprehensive overview and global configuration for the entire system. It defines the AI Agent's behavioral guidelines, output format, evidence requirements, thinking language, and other critical information.
    *   **It is crucial to read all `0.xxx.md` files thoroughly before commencing any specific task.** These files contain the foundational rules and expectations for the entire system.

2.  **`1.java-cpg.md` (and subsequent numbered task files)**
    *   The subsequent files (e.g., `1.java-cpg.md`, `2.build-and-run.md`, etc.) contain specific task instructions. They will detail the objective of each task, the content to be explained, evidence requirements, and output formatting.
    *   Please select the appropriate file to read and interact with based on the specific task you need the AI Agent to perform. These files are localized in scope but adhere to the global rules defined in `0.overview.md`.

## AI Agent Output File Location

All output files generated by the AI Agent will be stored under the `/claude/out/<task_number>/` directory, presented in Markdown format. For instance, the output for task `1.java-cpg.md` will be found in `/claude/out/1/`.

## Language Convention

Please note that the AI Agent will use English for internal thinking and external retrieval. However, the final output files and communication with you will be in Chinese, to match your preference.

**Now, please begin by reading `/claude/prompt/0.overview.md` to understand the system's global settings.**
